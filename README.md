# Identifying Significant Factors Affecting Business Demand

## Project Overview
This project analyzes which factors significantly affect business demand using data science techniques such as T-test and Linear Regression. A custom dataset of 200 service providers was created, and statistical tests were applied to identify key drivers of customer acquisition.

## Problem Statement
Businesses need to understand what influences customer demand to optimize their services and marketing strategies. This project identifies important factors such as Ratings, Discounts, Average Pricing, and Location that affect the number of customers.

## Methodology
- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- T-test to check the impact of offering discounts on customer numbers.
- Linear Regression to predict customer numbers based on service features.
- Visualization using heatmaps, scatter plots, and boxplots.

## Results
- Offering discounts significantly increases customer acquisition.
- Higher ratings positively correlate with greater customer numbers.
- Location and pricing also have an influence but to a lesser extent.
